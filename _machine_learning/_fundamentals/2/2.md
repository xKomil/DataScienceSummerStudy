# Step by step project as Data scientist
## Steps
- Look at the big picture 
- Get the data
- Explore and visualize the data to gain insights
- Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms
- Select a model and train it
- Fine-tune your model
- Present your solution
- Maintain your system

# Look at the big picture
- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
- What is the business goal?
- Select a performance measure
- Check the assumptions


A *pipeline* in machine learning refers to a sequence of data processing steps, where the output of one component is the input for the next. This structured flow ensures the systematic handling of data transformations, model training, and evaluation.

### Business goal / problem
In this example, the goal is to predict the median housing price in any district based on various metrics.
It's typical supervised learning task, because we can train the model with labeled examples (we have expected median housing price). 
It's a regression task, moreover its a multiple regression problem cause we use multiple features to make a preduction. 
It's a univariate regression since we trying to predict one value for each district. If it were to predict multiple value it would be a multivare regression. 

### Performance measure
[Ocena modeli][https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pszwed/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=med:med-w03.pdf]
*RMSE* - standardowy błąd regresji/estymaty
*MAE* - średni błąd regresji/estymaty

# Get the data

Download the data and then take a look at the data structure
atribute = column
Create a histogram look for capped data, look for values they are expressed

## **Create a test set**
Split the data into training and test sets

*Data snooping* bias occurs when a dataset is used more than once for model selection, training, or evaluation, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates and potentially misleading results. This bias arises from the leakage of information between the training and evaluation phases, which can inflate the apparent performance of a model.
